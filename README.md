# Popcorn Popper

## Background
Popcorn Popper is a single-player game in which a player earns points and ascends levels by popping popcorn kernels. The game plays out on a rectangular grid which is bordered by flames on the right-hand side and popcorn kernels on the left-hand side. Each cell of the grid contains a section of rope fuse which can be rotated on a click. In order to pop a kernel, the player must rotate fuse segments to form a continuous path from the fire to the kernel, allowing a flame to travel along the fuse. Once the kernel pops, all fuse pieces along the path burn up and disappear; these pieces will be replaced by randomly generated new fuse pieces. Some fuse pieces point in 3 or 4 directions at once, effectively splitting the flame and allowing the player to pop multiple kernels at once!

## Functionality & MVPs
In Popcorn Popper, the user will be able to:
* Start and stop a new game
* Play through different levels of increasing difficulty
* Rotate fuses on a click
* Construct fuse paths that ignite one or more popcorn kernels

In addition, this project will include:
* A production README
* A "How to Play" modal with game instructions
